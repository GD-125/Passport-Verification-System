BENEFITS OF USING MODELS


✅ BENEFITS:

1. CLEANER CODE
   - Controllers are much shorter and focused on business logic
   - Database queries are centralized in one place
   - Easier to read and maintain

2. REUSABILITY
   - Same model methods can be used across multiple controllers
   - No need to write the same SQL queries multiple times

3. EASIER TESTING
   - Can mock the models for unit testing
   - Test database logic separately from controllers

4. BETTER ORGANIZATION
   - Clear separation of concerns (MVC pattern)
   - Database logic separate from request handling

5. EASIER TO UPDATE
   - Change database schema? Update only the model
   - All controllers automatically use the new logic

6. TYPE SAFETY (if using TypeScript)
   - Models can have proper type definitions
   - Better IDE autocomplete and error checking

EXAMPLE COMPARISON:

❌ WITHOUT MODELS (Before):
const result = await pool.query(
  'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = $1',
  [username]
);
const user = result.rows[0];

✅ WITH MODELS (After):
const user = await User.findByUsername(username);

Much cleaner and easier to understand!
